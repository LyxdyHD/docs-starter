## Overview

Start from a still image and add motion. Great for product shots, key art, and social posts.

## Source guidelines

- High-resolution images with clear subjects and clean composition work best.
- Avoid heavy compression and extreme blur.
- Ensure important regions (faces, logos) are unobstructed for better fidelity.

## Parameters

- `durationSeconds`: Default 8; 4–12 for social-friendly clips.
- `frameRate`: Default 24.
- `motionStrength`: Default 0.6; 0.3–0.8 determines intensity.
- `motionDirection`: e.g., pan left/right, zoom in/out, parallax layers.
- `stabilizationStrength`: Default 0.5; reduces jitter.

## Workflow

- Upload your base image.
- Choose motion type and strength; set duration and frame rate.
- Generate multiple takes and evaluate subject stability and background motion.
- Refine with Motion Brush for targeted movement; export and upscale as needed.

## Examples

- Product shot with parallax: foreground product stable, background gentle parallax left → right.
-  Settings: `durationSeconds=6`, `motionStrength=0.5`, `stabilizationStrength=0.6`

- Landscape zoom: slow push-in across a sunset vista.
-  Settings: `durationSeconds=10`, `motionStrength=0.4`, `motionDirection=zoom-in`
