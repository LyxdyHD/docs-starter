## Overview

Create videos directly from a prompt. Control duration, frame rate, stabilization, and style for predictable results.

## Parameters

- `durationSeconds`: Default 8; recommended 4–15 depending on platform.
- `frameRate`: Default 24; recommended 24–30 for smooth motion.
- `stabilizationStrength`: Default 0.5; 0.3–0.7 reduces jitter while preserving dynamics.
- `styleIntensity`: Default 0.6; 0.4–0.8 balances realism vs stylization.
- `guidanceScale`: Default 7; 5–9 controls adherence to prompt.

## Workflow

- Write a clear prompt with subject, environment, camera, lighting, and motion.
- Set duration and frame rate; adjust stabilization and style intensity.
- Generate multiple takes; compare continuity, focus, and pacing.
- Export MP4/WebM at the desired aspect ratio; upscale if needed.

## Examples

- Prompt: "A futuristic space battle with laser beams and explosions, cinematic lighting, epic scale"
-  Settings: `durationSeconds=8`, `frameRate=24`, `stabilizationStrength=0.5`, `styleIntensity=0.7`
-  Output: fast-paced battle shots with bright laser streaks and dramatic explosions.

- Prompt: "Slow-motion ocean waves at sunset, warm color grading, gentle camera drift"
-  Settings: `durationSeconds=12`, `frameRate=24`, `stabilizationStrength=0.6`, `styleIntensity=0.5`
-  Output: smooth waves with orange-pink sky and subtle drift.

## Tips

- Include motion cues ("slow pan", "dynamic tracking", "steady cam") for camera behavior.
- Use negative prompts ("no text overlays", "no artifacts") to reduce unwanted elements.
- Save prompts and settings as presets for consistent branding.
