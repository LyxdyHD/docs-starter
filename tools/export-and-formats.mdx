## Formats

- MP4 (H.264) for broad compatibility
- WebM for web-focused delivery

## Aspect ratios

- 1:1 square — social grids
- 9:16 vertical — stories/reels
- 16:9 landscape — web and video platforms

## 4K export

- Use Upscaler before export for best clarity.
- Ensure bitrate is sufficient to avoid banding/compression artifacts.
- Longer durations at 4K require more time; consider 8–12s for fast iteration.

## Tips

- Keep consistent aspect ratios across a campaign.
- Test playback on mobile and desktop for motion clarity.
