## Acceptance of Terms

By creating an account or using VexRender, you agree to this Terms of Service and any policies referenced here. If you do not agree, do not use the service.

## Eligibility

Users must be 18 years or older to use VexRender.

## Usage Rules

### Zero Tolerance Policy

We strictly prohibit: deepfakes that violate rights, child sexual abuse material (CSAM), non‑consensual sexual content, harassment, hate, and any illegal acts. Violations result in immediate account suspension or termination.

### Responsible Use

You are responsible for prompts, inputs, and outputs generated with your account. Do not infringe copyrights, trademarks, privacy, or publicity rights.

## Ownership and License

### Your Rights

Subject to applicable law and third‑party rights, you own the commercial rights to the images and videos you generate on VexRender.

### VexRender License

If you choose to make content public (e.g., publish to Explore), you grant VexRender a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free license to display, reproduce, and promote that public content for product features and marketing.

## Credits, Billing, and Refunds

### Virtual Credits ("Stars")

VexRender operates on a virtual credit system. Credits (Stars) are consumed when you perform generations or enhancements.

### Non‑Refundable Credits

Credits are non‑refundable once purchased. We do not offer refunds for unsatisfactory generations because GPU costs are incurred immediately at the time of processing.

## Storage and Retention

### Temporary Storage

VexRender is not a cloud storage backup service. Generated assets stored temporarily may be automatically deleted after 24 hours if not explicitly saved or published.

### Data Loss

You are responsible for exporting and backing up assets. VexRender is not liable for lost or deleted data.

## Third‑Party Services and Models

We use AI models and infrastructure (including Google Cloud Vertex AI and cloud object storage) to provide the service. Third‑party terms may apply.

## Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

### "As Is" Service

VexRender is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We do not warrant that results will be error‑free, uninterrupted, or perfectly accurate.

### Limitation

To the maximum extent permitted by law, VexRender is not liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or exemplary damages arising from your use of the service.

## Termination

We may suspend or terminate accounts for violations of this Terms of Service or applicable law. You may stop using the service at any time.

## Changes to the Service and Terms

We may modify features or these terms to improve the service or comply with law. We will post updates in the documentation; continued use constitutes acceptance of changes.
