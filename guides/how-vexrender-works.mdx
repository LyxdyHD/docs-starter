## Concepts

- Prompts: describe subjects, motion, lighting, and mood for consistent results.
- References: guide composition or branding by supplying an input image.
- Parameters: adjust duration, frame rate, stabilization, style intensity, guidance.
- Enhancements: refine outputs with Motion Brush, Style Transfer, and Upscaler.

## Generation flow

- Text to Video: write a prompt → set duration/frame rate → generate takes → review continuity.
- Image to Video: upload image → choose motion settings → generate → refine with Motion Brush.

## Enhancement flow

- Motion Brush: paint regions → set direction/speed → preview → apply.
- Style Transfer: pick preset → set intensity → preserve structure fidelity → batch if needed.
- Upscaler: choose 2× or 4× → adjust detail and artifact reduction → export.

## Best practices

- Be specific: subject, environment, camera, lighting, color, motion.
- Use negative prompts to avoid artifacts or unwanted elements.
- Iterate with small parameter changes; save successful presets.
